# Traffic Gateway Samples

## Reference CSV Files

This repository holds reference CSV files, which we use to show examples of how to combine different elements of the Cinegy CSV specification to achieve results.

We try to keep this example up-to-date, but if you think this sample is wrong or is missing something, please email Cinegy support who will forward your request to the Traffic Gateway team.
